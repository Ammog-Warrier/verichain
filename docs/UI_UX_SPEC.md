# VeriChain UI/UX Specification

*   The application uses an **"Eco-Futurism" theme** featuring a primary **Emerald Green (#10B981)** for success states, primary actions, and badges, and a secondary **Slate Blue (#64748B)** for body text, borders, and secondary icons, set against a **Light Gray (#F3F4F6)** or clean **White (#FFFFFF)** background with a **Dark Mode** option using **Deep Slate (#0F172A)**.
*   All main containers, dashboards, and forms employ a **"Glassmorphism" effect**, utilizing a white background with **70% opacity**, a **`backdrop-blur-md`** CSS filter, and a thin, translucent white border (`border-white/20`) to create a premium, layered depth that sits above the background.
*   The **Navigation Bar** is sticky at the top of the viewport with a glass effect, containing the **"VeriChain" logo** on the left in bold, tracking-wide Emerald text, and dynamic buttons on the right: a **"Login" ghost button** (transparent background with Slate text) and a **"Register" primary button** (Emerald gradient background) for public users, which switch to a **"Dashboard" text link** and a **Red "Logout" icon** (using `lucide-react` LogOut) for authenticated users.
*   The **Landing Page** features a centered **Hero Section** with large, bold typography (e.g., "Trust, Verified.") in Slate Blue, a subheadline in lighter gray, and a prominent **"Scan QR Code" button** styled with a heavy Emerald-to-Teal gradient, a soft drop shadow (`shadow-lg`), and a camera icon, designed to be the primary call-to-action that draws immediate attention.
*   Below the main CTA on the Landing Page is a secondary **"Verify by ID" section** featuring a glass-styled input field with a transparent background, a solid bottom border that turns Emerald on focus, paired with a **"Verify" outline button** (transparent bg, Emerald border, Emerald text) for manual asset entry.
*   The **Login and Register pages** utilize a centered, floating **Glass Card layout** (max-width 400px) with input fields that have **floating labels** (moving up on focus), transparent backgrounds, and **focus rings** in Emerald Green, along with a **full-width "Sign In" or "Create Account" primary button** that transforms slightly on hover (scale 1.02).
*   The **Dashboard** displays a **"Welcome, {User}" header** followed by a row of **Stats Cards** (e.g., "Total Assets", "Pending Actions"), which are small glass panels displaying large, bold numbers in Emerald and trend indicators (e.g., "+5 this week") in small gray text.
*   A **"Create New Asset" button** is prominently displayed on the Dashboard (specifically for Producer roles), styled as either a **Floating Action Button (FAB)** in the bottom-right or a **Top-Right Primary Button** with a "Plus" icon and Emerald gradient to strongly encourage asset minting.
*   The **Asset List** on the Dashboard is contained within a large glass panel, featuring rows that **highlight (light gray bg) on hover**, displaying columns for **Asset ID** (mono-font), **Color**, **Size**, and **Owner**, with a small **"View Details" outline button** (or chevron icon) at the end of each row to access the full view.
*   The **Create Asset Form** is a detailed glass card with input fields for **Color**, **Size**, and **Owner**, and specifically highlights the **"Appraised Value" field** with a **"Lock" icon** inside the input and a subtle **"Private Data" tooltip** to visually indicate to the user that this specific data point will be encrypted and stored in the Private Data Collection.
*   The **"Mint Asset" button** on the creation form is a large, full-width button that shows a **loading spinner** and a **pulse animation** upon clicking to indicate the blockchain transaction is being processed and to prevent double-submissions.
*   Upon successful asset creation, a **QR Code Modal** appears with a dark semi-transparent backdrop (`bg-black/50`), displaying the generated QR code on a stark white card for contrast, accompanied by a **"Print" outline button** and a **"Done" primary button** to close the modal.
*   The **Asset Detail View** presents a card divided into two distinct visual sections: a **"Public Data" section** with standard styling for Color/Size/Owner, and a **"Private Data" section** (visible only to authorized users like Regulators/Owners) styled with a distinct **light green background** or **green border** and a **"Confidential" badge** to clearly distinguish the data types.
*   The **Public Verify Page** features a clean, distraction-free layout centered around a large **"Verified by VeriChain" badge** with a **pulsing green checkmark animation** to instantly build trust with the consumer.
*   On the Public Verify Page, the asset data (ID, Color, Size) is displayed in **large, readable typography** on a glass card, while sensitive fields like Appraised Value are either **completely hidden** or replaced with a **"Redacted/Private" placeholder** with a lock icon to demonstrate privacy preservation.
*   All interactive elements like buttons and cards feature smooth **`framer-motion` hover effects** (e.g., `whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}`) and **page transitions** (fade in/slide up) to enhance the "premium" and "modern" feel of the application.
*   **Error states** (e.g., "Asset Not Found", "Login Failed") are displayed via a **Toast notification system** appearing at the top-right, styled in **Red/White glass** with an alert icon, rather than inline text, to keep the UI clean and prevent layout shifts.
*   **Loading states** are represented by **Skeleton Loaders** (shimmering gray bars) in place of text/lists during data fetching, rather than a generic full-screen spinner, to maintain perceived performance.
